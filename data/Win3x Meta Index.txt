But while searching the ruins he falls into a trap door and is suddenly in a big underground complex. Now he has to find a way back to the surface and discover the real purpose of this apparent tomb.The puzzles are mostly Myst-style logic puzzles on a big scale. To solve these puzzles the player has to search the tomb and perceive and understand the engravings of this old civilization. This knowledge is mostly used to put old machines into operation or deactivate deadly traps. The player quickly finds a notice book of another archaeologist who apparently already explored most of the complex. This serves as a subtle ingame help system - it doesn't give the solutions but hints to the nature of the puzzles.In 1997 it got a complete overhaul and was re-released as Entombed Enhanced.

Once you have collected all the sour notes in an area it glows red on the map, so you know how much you've done. In addition, clicking on the music note on the bottom right of the screen brings up the options, where you can click on Hopsalot's bag to see how many sour notes have been collected.When all the sour notes are collected and brought to the Concert Hall to be sweetened, Hopsalot presents you with a Sweet Note award that can be printed.

Sports	Sensible Golf is a 2D golf simulation.Having been quite successful with their cute action soccer game Sensible Soccer, Sensible Software decided that the concept of "No fuss, just fun" could be applied to other sports, too. They chose golf.Sensible Golf is not an accurate simulation of golf, but an action adaptation of the sport streamlined for quick and easy gameplay. Consequently, complications such as wind and terrain heights are not featured, although the green has little arrows indicating the slopes. Apart from that, the player's only concerns are the water and sand hazards, and the distance to the hole. As a result, Sensible Golf is instead a practice in target shooting, rather than a golf game.Striking involves only two action: Aiming the pointer in the desired direction, and pressing the action button three times. The game uses the well-known three-click-control, with which you set power and swerve of the strike. The computer automatically suggests a proper club, but the player may change it manually. A pop-up map helps one find their bearing. The courses are fictional, composed from a pool of holes which often appear in multiple courses, sometimes with minor variations. Play modes include single 18-hole rounds, a complete season and a tournament. Up to 72 human players may participate in the latter.

Action;Adventure;Role-Playing	Shadows of Darkness is the fourth Quest for Glory game. It is a journey into the land of Mordavia - a setting influenced by Eastern Europe, particularly its Slavic areal. The hero had just begun to enjoy his victory in Tarna, when a spell zapped him into parts unknown, without a weapon, items, or even a source of light. Shortly after finding his way out of the dark cave, the hero meets a mysterious woman named Katrina. He traverses the swamps in the dark forest and finally reaches the town. However, the town is also engulfed by a foreboding atmosphere, and the hero cannot allow himself to relax. He must find out what is going on, why the town inhabitants are so hesitant and reluctant to help him, and what horrors are lurking outside of its walls. Life has never been quite so dangerous for our hero. He'll discover his quest soon enough - that is, if he lives.Like the previous Quest For Glory titles, the game is a combination of puzzle-solving adventure and role-playing. The player character can be a fighter, a thief, a magician, or a paladin. Importing a character from a preceding installment of the series is also possible. Once again the hero improves his skills by repeatedly using them (like throwing stones at a tree to improve the throwing ability, which might be needed to solve a puzzle). Combat system in this installment has undergone a major change. Battles are viewed from a side-scrolling perspective and are action-oriented. The protagonist is able to move freely, jump, and execute attacks and defensive moves, similarly to fighting games. The CD version of the game adds voice-overs to conversations as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.

The CD-ROM is supposed to be an authoritative look at the history and origins of these beasties. Includes: virtual 3D environments for each creature, 3D animation, video, narration, color illustration and original and historical documents. It begins in a castle with four doors, two of which are designed to take you to the sections on "Legendary Lands and Lost Cities" and "Legendary Heroes and Villains" available as further volumes in the series. When you get to the end of the corridor, you find yourself outside with several glowing gems embedded in the terrain. Clicking on one will take you to a section on one (or more) of the monsters. It takes a bit of stumbling around to discover which creature is tied to which gem. After you've gathered all your information about a creature, the game treats you to an animation of what it was supposed to look like. The music is appropriately ominous, the graphics are beautifully detailed (you'll need to know how to switch your monitor to at least 32,000 colors) and narrator Patrick Floersheim, dressed as a monk, is appropriately hammy.

In this game, Addie the Kangaroo, Rufus the Dog, and Katie the Chameleon, help you while you are playing. Your job is to help Doctor Max Rigby, who has many sick animals in her animal park. Doctor Rigby takes you to a map in her ranch house, which shows you the four areas you can explore. There is the Savanna, the Farm, the Forest, and the Desert to explore. Once you enter an area, you can either find a sick animal or play a mini-game. Once you click on a sick animal, you go to the field hospital to check up on the animal. There are many tools to use, such as a x-ray, a scale, a thermometer, a microscope, and a stethoscope. Once you find what is wrong with the animal, you give it the correct treatment so it can heal. Once the animal heals, you will get a certificate and a letter from the animal showing that it is all better. The six mini-games are accessed in either the map or the Activity Center, including Weigh Cool, Ordering Life Cycles, Desert Treasures, Animal Crackers, Feeding Frenzy, and Animal Artistry. Every single mini-game has two difficulty settings except for Animal Artistry, which is a creativity game. There are also many things to do in the ranch house, such as reading about famous doctors, clicking on fun surprises, and a glossary which teaches you words that are found in the game.

433w	PipeDr3x	Pipe Dream (1991).zip	24192862	Pipe Dream (1991)	1991	The Assembly Line	Microsoft Corporation	Puzzle	Each level of this abstract puzzler challenges the player to set up a network of pipes to allow an unspecified substance known as 'flooz' to flow through as many of those as possible. The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere. However a situation that can often occur is there will be a long and complex piping arrangement set up, yet a gap somewhere remains to be filled. Players are able to  replace a piece with another in the same square (to make it easier to flow the flooz that way), but for a slight scoring penalty.Bonuses are awarded for looping the flooz through both sides of at least 5 cross-over pieces, or passing the flooz through every square on the screen. Later levels have some squares on the grid blocked off, a few gaps in the side-wall (allowing flooz to thread to the other side of the screen). After every four levels there is a bonus game for points, in which the player can only place the pieces in the lowest open space in each column, similarly to the board game of "Connect 4".

Rather than it being read in a linear fashion, the game's story is decided by the player as to which order of planets they want to explore. It also includes a number of interactive activities (or minigames) which aren't essential to advance the story, but are mostly there for the sake of livening up to the game's format. So it's a storybook with some adventure gaming elements in it.	Educational: Science		Not Rated	Single Player		false	e4ff5f5b-9f73-b7e8-4fa5-a5a711637628

The once great continents have been drastically changed into thousands of tiny islands and various cities have washed into the oceans. During this turmoil, Zorgeuf the Great rushes to conquer the bewildered world along with a troop of commanders and declares the Earth Empire. The only hope to defeat him lies from without Earth, as the Colonial Forces send a command carrier from the major orbital base. With so many armies gone, the ground infantry unit has been replaced by the Metal Marine, a fifty foot armored robot that can be sent into battle for attack or defense. From their respective Command Center, each side in the conflict will need to direct the placement of facilities on the ground to defend against enemy attack, manage resources and successfully strike the enemy.[13][10][13][10]Metal Marines is an isometric strategy game. Controlling one side of a conflict, the player must wage a campaign across several islands to defeat Zorgeuf and his lieutenants. The player controls logistics of the base to ensure that there are the necessary assets to wage war. On each map, the player places three underground command bases, if all of these are destroyed the battle is lost. The player must manage the resources of their money to construct new buildings or upgrade existing facilities on the map. Different buildings include Energy Plants, Factories, Economic Centers, Radar systems, Anti-Aircraft missiles, fake buildings and fake HQ bases, mine fields, gun pods, missile launchers, metal marine hangers and even ICBMs. At any time, the player may order an attack and choose which assets to fire at the opponent. Missiles, Metal Marines carriers and ICBMs all use different levels of fuel. Metal Marines once deployed in an area will automatically fire rifles at nearby targets or engage even closer targets in melee attacks. Gunpods, while stationary, will also fire on nearby enemies. Metal Marines are largely autonomous but can be manually controlled to a minor degree (directional) by the player.

Education	Jump Start Pre-K follows (in age-range) and builds on the skills learned in Jump Start Preschool in Knowledge Adventure's lineup of learning games created for each grade and age-group. In this game for the 3 - 5 year old, the player is taken to  the colorful main page: a town map full of clickable icons leading to activities and song. Each activity begins at the easiest level, and can be adjusted manually, or the game will automatically adjust as the player responds with correct answers. All actions are point and click and there are many clickable places on the map and in each area that produce animations. As the player progresses through an area, correct answers will earn him stars, and four stars give him a chance to pick an object (trees, playground equipment, characters) to place in the town park named for him. The areas to explore are:   Carousel - Clicking the number on the carousel that matches the number of balloons the mouse holds lets the mouse climb aboard  Bakery - the player follows verbal and pictured instruction to connect frosting dots on a cake  Airport - using onscreen arrows or the arrow keys, the player moves a plane up and down on a scrolling screen, flying through clouds with shapes that do not match a pictured shape. In free play mode, clicking the paint bucket allows the player to decorate the skies with color or patterns  Fire Station - a memory game; the player turns over objects around the station to reveal pictures and make a match  Diner - Kisha sets out food in an ordered row (dark to light, full to empty) and then mixes it up; the player must put it back into the same order  Barbershop - a musical matching game with similarities to Simon; the player matches a sequence of shapes which in turn cause the barbershop septet to sound off a short tune  Clothing Store - the player must put together a letter jigsaw to be "ironed" onto a t-shirt; the T-shirts can then be printed as coloring pages  Toy Shop - the player builds the toy shown on the right by choosing parts from the shelves; one click attaches the part, and wrong parts must be clicked again to remove before the toy reaches the end of the conveyor belt  Construction Site - the player loads up a truck before it enters a tunnel by clicking on objects that match a given one  Park - As the player wins stars for correct answers in the activities, four stars will allow him to choose objects to arrange in the park  On the bottom left of the screen is a blue notebook icon where parents can access a progress report showing the percentages of correct and attempted answers for each skill covered. The focus of this game is on decision-making and problem-solving as well as beginning to learn letters, shapes, colors and numbers.

1108w	SimPark	SimPark (1996).zip	223997354	SimPark	1996	Maxis Software Inc.	Maxis Software Inc.	Construction and Management Simulation;Simulation	Made by Maxis, the company famous for its line of "Sim" games, SimPark deals with the simulation and management of a real wildlife park.  SimPark allows you to build and manage parks from scratch, completely isolated from civilization.  You have the choice of choosing from hundreds of different species of flowers, bushes, plants, mammals, birds, and reptiles to live and thrive in your park.  Which plants and animals to put in is completely your choice, but you have to make sure that their biological needs are met so that they won't die.  You start out with a bare patch of land, but as you add plants and animals, it will begin to grow.  Depending on the climate and food available, certain animals will even begin migrating to your park.  SimPark contains a massive database of plants and animals that you need to use in order for your park to flourish.  Over hundreds of species are cataloged in SimPark, and each article includes a brief bio, their scientific name, their wants and needs, and even an authentic recording of what each animal sounds like.  You need to utilize this information to figure out what plants and animals to put in your park, in order for the creatures to flourish.  If a creature or plant does not get enough food, a plant does not like the climate, or trees do not get the amount of water they need, your park will not grow.When plants and animals are placed incorrectly, the park becomes unstable.  Weeds and animals will begin to overpopulate the park.  Other trees will die or get overeaten by rampaging species.  Because of this, the game tries to teach the concept of a "balanced ecosystem."  It is up to you to have an understanding of the animals in your park to preserve a balance.  Only through a perfectly balanced biological system can all of the creatures flourish.Besides the biological aspect, there is also the managerial aspect of it.  Above all, it is up to you to manage the budget for the park.  Planting trees and adapting animals costs money, and if you can't manage that money, you're fired.  Even though you get federal funding each year, it is also important to attract visitors to the park to make a little income.  You need to make provisions for humans, like paths and bathrooms.  You also have to make sure visitors behave and do not litter or ravage the park.  Besides this, you also have the duty to identify species in your park, through a mini-game which has you identify them through their characteristics.  As well, you may  have to decide on other things like if you want to receive donations, or cater to boyscout parties (which might have negative affects on the ecosystem).Like any classic Sim game, you can ravage your own park with disasters.  You can simulate a garbage dump disaster (a large pile of garbage and lots of rats), a fire, an alien invasion (pink and blue blobs that create garbage) and a kudzu infestation.

624w	daleks3x	Daleks (1991).zip	26200065	Daleks	1991	John Wu	Freeware	Strategy	Following in the footsteps of the early UNIX game Robots (and perhaps from there the still-earlier BASIC game Chase?), this game puts the player in charge of a little protagonist, often claimed to be The Doctor, occupying a position on a top-down grid which is otherwise strewn, not with mines, but with those killer cyborgs which are his personal nemesis, the Daleks.  They have no long-range weapons, but if they touch him, he will find himself ex-ter-min-ated!Fortunately for him, contact with them is as lethal to each other as it is to him.  Every time he takes a step, they all draw one square closer to him; The Doctor's cunning strategy is to manoeuvre himself so as to cause their paths to intersect and the Daleks to terminally collide, leaving a pile of rubble dangerous both to him and to subsequent Daleks -- a strategy not always possible on the narrow confines of a grid.  Fortunately for the good Doctor, where this game outdoes its predecessors is that he also has his trusty Sonic Screwdriver in hand, whose offensive use destroys all Daleks within a threatening one-square radius of him.  Also, it allows him to teleport out of harm's way to a random location on the map -- hopefully one behind a pile of Dalek rubble, and not one within a single step of a Dalek currently on the map.  In many versions both Sonic Screwdriver and Teleport use are limited.  Should The Doctor survive this onslaught, he is brought to a new grid map, generally one populated with still further Daleks.Other features particular to some versions and absent from others include the use of graphical tiles vs. mere roguelike textmode character representation, and occasionally a conversion will use (universally unlicensed) sound effects taken from canonical Doctor Who sources; more commonly these games also offer a Last Stand command, to be used, like the "drop" in Tetris, when the player is so confident in the security of their location that they are willing to sit tight and grant the Daleks as many moves as it takes to either reach The Doctor or be rendered down into scrap metal through unforeseen collision.  Successful use of the Last Stand often results in a score bonus; unsuccessful use of it, of course, results in The Doctor's death.  (Don't worry, chances are good that he'll regenerate into a new incarnation -- not in this game, however.)Some versions feature keyboard directional control (in which sometimes the player is granted access to diagonal movement like the Daleks are, and sometimes not), while others present The Doctor with a halo of directional arrows around him, to move him one step in the appropriate direction if an arrow is clicked upon.  Generally he also has the option of standing in place and passing a turn.	Fangames; Theme: Sci-Fi		Not Rated	Single Player		false	a88ca5f4-c0ea-d7f8-0e49-49ed7c9e542c

823w	Kyodai	Kyodai (1997).zip	24192774	Kyodai Mahjongg	1997	René‑Gilles Deberdt	Freeware	Puzzle	A shareware Shanghai-like solitaire game system that uses Mah-Jongg tiles.  Contains a number of unique or non-standard games.  Created and programmed by a fan of Mah-Jongg solitaire.The games are presided over by manga-style girls, who react to the gameplay, let you know you're in the high score board, etc.  High score lists are maintained for all games, all skill levels.  The game is fully customizable- backgrounds, tilesets, and music can be changed (and new selections are available for download through the official site.)  Dragon layout can also be changed, for variety greater than the traditional game provides.Game variations: Solitaire: the standard, famous game, with the standard, famous "dragon" (layout).  Click tile pairs to remove them, if the tiles are free to move to the side.Rivers: same tiles, square layout, new rules; tile pairs must be free to move from side or top, and there can be no more than two 90 degree "turns" to bring the two tiles together.  Players of the old/rare arcade game "Sports Match" will understand the mechanics.Memory: same tiles, square layout; tiles need not be "free", but since they're all turned over, you must remember where partner tiles are located.Clicks: new tiles (color-based rather than MahJongg based).  Based on a freeware game, "Clickomania" (and Sega Swirl is suspiciously similar to it, too.)  Tiles of different colors can be removed if there are more than one of the same color connected.  Gravity affects remaining tiles, which create a dynamic, moving playfield.  Remove as many as possible, and leave as few tiles remaining as possible.Slider: same tiles as Clicks.  Slide tiles around to form 5-tile lines (and remove them).  Each move adds 3 new tiles to the board.Hashira: same tiles as Clicks.  Falling 3-tile sets must be combined to remove combinations of same-colored tiles.  Incredibly similar to Columns.The early versions of Kyodai are suitable for Windows 3.1+.  Middle versions are suitable for Windows 95+, and are in 2D.  The latest versions are in 3D, and use DirectX technology.  (OpenGL versions are also available.)

The game shows only one perspective at the time but by using one of the three scanners the perspective shifts and it also says how many enemy ships are on he chosen axis. Just like in Battleship he doesn't know where these ships exactly are. He has to aim his airship's gun to a certain coordinate - if he hits an enemy ship, it gets destroyed. The position also gets marked so he doesn't shoot the same field twice. The Zilog ships don't shoot back - the difficulty are the limited fuel and rocket reserves which are reduced with every movement respectively shot. There are overall three difficulty settings.

Adventure;Detective / Mystery	Police Quest: Open Season is the fourth installment in the Police Quest series. It abandons the story arc of the previous three games, introducing a new setting and a new protagonist, homicide detective John Carey of the Los Angeles Police Department. Carey finds his best friend and ex-partner, Officer Bob Hickman, murdered in an alley in the Southern part of the city. An eight-year-old boy named Bobby Washington has been murdered as well. Carey begins an investigation that leads him deep into the criminal life of the city and a hunt for a maniacal murderer.[13][10][13][10]The game utilizes Sierra's traditional icon-based interface for interaction with the environment and generally follows an adventure format. However, it focuses on realistic police procedures even more than the previous games in the series. Much of the gameplay is dedicated to examining crime scenes, questioning suspects, and conducting a by-the-book investigation. There is a considerable degree of freedom in the interaction, allowing the player to perform actions not connected to the main story, some of which will, however, lead to the protagonist's death. The game utilizes digitized photorealistic images for its visuals.	Police Quest series		Not Rated	Single Player		false	f5591271-7604-0751-d711-112541e1019c

Action;Platform;Shooter	A young physics professor named Lester conducts a particle experiment. Suddenly, something goes wrong, a lightning strikes, and in a moment Lester finds himself in a strange alien world. Now he must fight for his life, first with his bare hands, then with a gun he finds. But what gives him courage is that he is not alone. One of the aliens who escapes from the prison together with him helps him on his dangerous quest. Friendship can overcome all the obstacles.Another World (Out of This World in the US) combines shooting, platforming, and puzzle-solving elements. The game is divided into stages; some of them are straightforward and can only be accessed one time, while others are connected to each other, constituting a larger environment. Exploration and problem-solving are emphasized. Many levels include challenges not seen in the previous ones. Tasks may involve environmental puzzles, timed sequences, precise jumping, and combat.Typically, enemies are defeated by using an energy gun found in an early stage. The gun's regular function is shooting energy projectiles. By pressing down and holding the fire button the player can activate an energy shield which protects Lester from regular attacks, allowing him to fire from relative safety until it evaporates. Finally, by holding the fire button even longer the gun creates powerful blasts which can disrupt shields. Most enemies are equipped with similar guns and are able to perform the same actions as Lester. Fighting enemies therefore requires tactical usage of regular attacks, shields, and bombs, as well as learning enemy patterns.Each level can be accessed by typing a code the player learns after having completed the level. If Lester dies, the level must be restarted. There is no on-screen interface and no in-game dialogue in the game. Vector graphics are used for creating the game's environments and animated cutscenes.

When it first appeared in 1986, MAUS, Art Spiegleman's memoir of his father's experiences during the Holocaust, was hailed as a powerful work of history. It represented a new level of maturity for a century-old art form; namely comix, which to that point had mostly been a medium for superhero fantasies and funny animal stories.

The pages of MAUS are linked to preliminary sketches, alternate drafts, archival photographs, and drawings made by prisoners and audio from the interviews between Art Spiegelman and his father that were the basis for the narrative. In addition, there is QuickTime video and audio of Art Spiegelman discussing the making of MAUS, and critical commentary on the form, ideas, and history behind this powerful, groundbreaking work.

The first teaches children about the stares of the USA, where they are and what their names are. The second teaches children about other countries in the world and where they are located.The 'Geography Puzzle Game' is the game that teaches the US states. It has two modes of play, easy and hard. Both modes of play break the states of mainland USA (i.e. not including Alaska & Hawaii) into four zones. The player selects a zone and is presented with a sliding tile type of puzzle in which the tiles are in the shape of the states in the selected zone. In the easy mode all the player has to do is place the tile into its correct position and the game will display and speak the state's name. When all states have been positioned correctly Snoopy walks on screen waving the US flag and music plays. In the hard mode the player again places the state in its correct position, upon which the game displays a list of all the states in the zone, so that the player can choose the correct name for the state that has just been placed. The Great Country Shoot game takes place in a circus in front of a globe and is a 1 or 2 player game. The player is asked to help one of the Snoopy characters find a country. The player jumps into a cannon, the globe spins, the player clicks on a region with their mouse and the character is fired from the cannon to parachute down to the selected location. If the player has selected the correct location the player gets a message of congratulation and is shown the character standing in the designated country.The gameplay changes depending upon the level that has been achieved by the player(s). In level 1 when the player is asked to locate a country the correct region of globe flashes red/green before the globe spins so that all the player must do is click on that region as it comes into view. In level 2 the player proceeds as in level 1 but when the region has been selected correctly the player must then select the correct country from the regional map. Level 3 is the same as level 2 but with a wider range of countries. Levels 4 to 7 have progressively more obscure countries to find and give no hints as to which region of the globe they are in. There are ten questions per level and at the end of the level the player is given their score.

After Pinocchio realizes his dream of becoming a real boy, the evil Lorenzini kidnaps him and turns him back into a puppet. You must help Pinocchio's creator, Geppetto, find and rescue him.  You'll go through Pinocchio's home town, row a boat through monster-infested waters and visit Terra Magica, the fair where Lorenzini turns boys into donkeys. To succeed, you'll have to dodge deadly traps, solve puzzles and outwit Lorenzini's conniving henchmen. Sometimes, you'll have to turn yourself into a puppet, a fish, a bird or even a donkey to rescue Pinocchio.  Along the way you must collect six passwords, each reflecting a lesson in morality that Pinocchio learns. You are aided by live-action guides Lumina and Candlewick who will offer different suggestions as to what to do but you must decide.  There are plenty of wide-screen scenes from the movie and a ton of original footage. The game comes on 4 CDs ("The Village", "The Forest", "The Sea", and "Terra Magica") because of the FMV (though the video takes up only half the screen), each disk representing another world to explore.  You must make plot choices and solve puzzles through clicking on the interface around the FMV or on the FMV itself.

He can also hook onto duck heads and swing from them to reach areas he normally couldn't.  You'll need to constantly find Yin-Yang coins to fuel your Ninja persona, otherwise you'll run out and transform back to Maui Mallard.The level layout in the Game Boy version is slightly different with less secrets to be found.

The object of the game is to achieve a score high enough to be recorded on the high score table.[13][10][13][10]The player takes the role of a mercenary hired to keep the space lanes clear. This means dropping into sector after sector of space and destroying any ship that is present. The limitations are that the canon will overheat if overused and that each sector jump uses fuel which must be replenished by visiting a star base.[13][10][13][10]In combat there is the tactical scanner which looks like a red radar screen. This gives an indication of the position and number of enemy ships and, when combined with target direction indicators in the targeting window, help the player blast the bad guys.[13][10][13][10]The game is played out in the cockpit of the ship and is entirely mouse controlled. The mouse functions in two ways. In 'ship' mode moving the mouse steers the ship while the left mouse button fires the canon. The left mouse button toggles between this mode and 'cockpit' mode in which the player can select either the 'Eject' button to end the game or the 'NavTrack' screen in which the player selects the next sector to jump to.

Action	This collection is a set of four "retro games" based on fondly remembered titles from the 1980's. BOT Your mission is to prevent the Mother CPU from completing its military conquest of the planet. To succeed you'll need to pass through 5 levels of BOT soldiers shooting them at will, including a larger BOT boss at the end of every level. Try to pick up extra grenades, armor protection, and more powerful weaponry along the way to assist you in accomplishing this task. Finding the experimental lightning gun is especially helpful, since it inflicts twice as much damage on enemies as your normal gun.BUBBLE TROUBLE You control a spaceship which you must use to clear the starlanes of subspace vortices (which look like terrestrial water bubbles). You must avoid contact with these vortices and shots by your own weapons, or your energy will slowly drain away. Your ship is armed with two weapons: guns, which are weak but use up little energy; and penetrators, which are strong but use up much more energy. Ship energy is used for thrusting, subspace jumping, and conducting repairs. Shields are used for defense only, and you lose shield power when you come in contact with vortices, bullets, penetrators, saucers, or stationary energy barbs.FLAK ATTACK A horde of robot commandos are attacking your base from the skies above. You control a single gun which you must aim and fire to stop the invaders, but don't run out of ammunition, or your base will certainly be destroyed. When a robot parachutes to the ground, it will walk towards your base and stand beside it.  When 4 robots gather on one side of the base, they will destroy it, and the game will be over. The enemy ships include satellites, jets, and helicopters.  Satellites fly past at high speeds, but they cannot harm your base directly. Jets fly overhead quickly, and the pilot will eject if you fire enough shots at it. Helicopters drop parachuting robots as they pass. Friendly UN Helicopters will drop extra ammo on your base if you let them fly peacefully overhead. MOLE'S QUEST As Monty the Mole, you must rescue your belongings which the miners have scattered throughout the mines after they destroyed your beautiful home. Jump from platform to platform from the left to the right, grab the belonging, and jump back to the left to safely pass each level. Each time you save ten belongings, you will see an animation of Monty taking the rescued belongings to his new home. Since the mines are covered with radioactive ooze, you must limit your exposure to no more than 5 minutes at a time. That should be sufficient time to rescue each of your belongings. Every time you save a belonging, you will be given a password, so you can continue from the level where you stopped, even if you shut off your computer.

Die total verrⁿckte Rallye)  is a strategy game for up to eight players with similarities to board games like Monopoly. The players join a rally through Europe and North Africa which consists of several stages. At the beginning of each stage a TV moderator names the capital of a country. The one who gets there first will win a lot of money. At first there are only Western European countries available but eventually the Berlin Wall falls and you can enter the former Eastern bloc.You play on a map of Europe consisting of many fields merged with each other through lines. Before every turn a player dices and then he can move his figure over the fields. You can freely decide the route to your target but you have to notice on which field you would end your turn. There are: Red fields: When you end your turn on a red field, you'll lose money.  Blue fields: Money will be credited to your account.  Yellow fields: You get a playing card. You can use these cards before every turn to your own advantage (i.e. use five dices instead of one) or to your opponent's disadvantage (i.e. having him transferred to a corner of the map).  Purple fields: On a purple field you can buy or sell cards.  Gray fields: Gray fields are cities. In a city you can buy buildings and earn rent every turn. When you own every building in a city, you have a monopoly and earn more rent. Contrary to Monopoly you don't have to pay anything when you come to a city where one of the other players have buildings.  Black and white fields: These fields represent the capital of a country. Buying buildings there is much more expensive but you will earn more rent.Another aspect of the game is Dr. Drago. Drago is played by the computer and appears after stage one and will follow the player who had the highest distance to the target of the previous stage. After every turn Drago will waste parts of your money, sell or buy buildings to terrible prices or destroy your cards. To get rid of him you can use a Drago playing card (if you own one and Drago has not ripped it to pieces yet) or overtake one of the players. When you pass them, Drago will leave you and chase your opponent. The winner of the game is the one who has the most money on his account after all stages. You could even win without winning a single stage but it's more difficult because you won't make that much profit with trying to end your turns on blue fields. And of course, Drago will haunt you the whole time when you are cruising in Northern Africa while all the stages end somewhere else.

Magically transported into the world described in the book, he needs to explore Myst Island and solve its mysteries.

Through Myst Island, the game is further divided into mini-worlds set in different ages accessed through different books.[13][10][13][10]The game's interface is reduced to a single cursor for navigation and interaction. Rather than collecting items and using them to solve puzzles, the player must gather subtly placed clues and manipulate complex mechanical devices in order to advance in the game.

Upon the arrival of the passengers, a mega-contest is announced. This contest includes various kinds of sports and activities, from bowling to love-making. The winner will get to "score" with the sexy Captain Thigh. Naturally, there is no way Larry can win this contest fairly, so he must use his brains to solve the tricky puzzles of the game, and cheat his way into the Captain's bed.The game's structure is similar to that of its predecessor: the entire game takes place in a large enclosed area (in this case, the cruise ship), with the gameplay focusing on inventory-based puzzles and conversations. The game features a context-sensitive interface: clicking on an object brings forth a series of verbs which the player can choose in order to interact with the given object. In addition to that, it is possible to try and type any other verb (provided the game understands it), just like in old adventure games with text interface. Sometimes it is necessary to think outside of the box and come up with unusual actions in order to solve a puzzle.Several new features have been added to the game, attempting to make players into more "active" participants of the playing process. Using a microphone, players can add their own voices, while using a scanner lets players insert their own photos into the game. Another feature that grabs attention is the automatic wallpaper.

Adventure;Detective / Mystery;Education	This is a CD-ROM history lesson cleverly designed as a mystery. The Queen's necklace has been stolen, and you, the trusty investigator, have a short six days to track down the thief. The Royal Palace at Versailles is the scene of the crime. Aided by the mischievous Louis Cat Orze, a feline of royal descent if there ever was one, you must explore the palace and the surrounding countryside, listen in on conversations, and occasionally pick a pocket. Louis Cat Orze isn't a free ride, though-fees must be paid, palms greased, and while you begin the game with a certain amount of livres, you have to investigate thoroughly and learn about the era in order to earn more. Or you can try your hand at the Palace Games to increase (or decrease) your purse. Once you think you know the identity of the thief, you can present your accusation to the king - if you can afford to see him, and if you haven't been thrown into the Bastille! It has its share of pitfalls; some of these you learn by doing, and some are buried in the manual (read it completely). You'll need to listen carefully to understand what's going on, for what people say can lead you in different directions - some are plausible dead ends, but some will be of real value. Learning about the 17th century is the only way you'll win. The drawings are somewhat cartoonish and the animation is minimal. Secret passages, exchanges of money in the Orangerie, the clink of gold coins in the Grand Apartment and gossip in the Hall of Mirrors all play an important part in this riveting mystery. You only have six days to solve the mystery. The game includes 75 biographies of people who lived during this period. A mesmerizing soundtrack is performed by a full chamber orchestra.

Action;Adventure	This graphics adventure game from Skybox (the well-known trading card company), came with three packs (18 cards total) of Skyborg trading cards. In the game, you are the Skyborg. The objective is to find and rescue Dr. Barton from his kidnapper(s) and escape. Along the way you will visit nine varied worlds, each of which has things needed to complete the game. While wandering around, you will encounter 95 characters in the form of cards, some of which are on walls or posters; many of the character cards are just standing around for you to walk up and acquire tools, knowledge, and weapons from them, a very unrealistic and unbelievable concept. There are several times in the game when you have to battle a "sentinel" (robot) in an action sequence (it's easy to die here). Overall, the graphics in Skyborg are not particularly outstanding, although some of the animations are actually quite good (the equipment repair/morphing sequence is pretty cool). Most of the graphics are static pictures with scattered hot-spots. There is quite a bit of text to read, which comes across as notes found or electronic messages received by Skyborg; these latter messages are printed on the screen in tiny letters and are difficult to read without getting close to the monitor. The audio has its moments, although the voice of Skyborg's nemesis, the evil Morb, comes across as very amateurish and grating; the original soundtrack and music is provided by the band Primal Future.

Each card has a value and one suit is called "Trumpf". In every round each player looses one of his card and the one which played the "Trumpf" card with the highest value gets all the played cards. If no "Trumpf" is played the highest value scores. At the end each player counts the values of his cards. The goal for the single player is to get more points than the other two combined.[13][10][13][10]The main feature of Skat 2010 is the integration of many local skat variants. If your favorite rule set is not included you can create it yourself with the freely adjustable rules.

The story tells of Hercules being born to Zeus and Hera. Due to the animosity of Hades, Hercules is stolen from his immortal parents and made mortal, though still extremely strong. He is then raised on earth by a mortal couple. Troubled by his great strength, Hercules prays to Zeus for advice and finds out that he is god-born. But, he cannot come back to Olympus until he becomes a hero. A true Hero. So, he is sent to the Satyr Philoctetes, who agrees to train him (after a little convincing from Zeus). Can Hercules become a hero? Each scene features brief text, narrated by two jive-talking Muses. Screen animation and character dialog follow. At this point the screen becomes static and the user has the opportunity to explore, clicking on objects that cause the lightening bolt-medallion cursor to change. Five activities can be accessed, including a matching game; a checkers activity; maze game; a monster-creation activity; and our reviewers' favorite, a viewing of the night sky complete with constellation discovery and descriptions. Also included in the program is a 'Sing-A-Long' section which includes three songs from the Hercules movie that can be enjoyed as sing-a-longs, or sung alone Karoke-style.

Kids can also read the facts on author Rudyard Kipling and guide their way through a photo tour of India, most of this information is available on CD-ROM encyclopedias. A Top Banana game features a slingshot, equipped with a banana. Kids use their mouse to aim the banana-powered slingshot at hungry jungle monkeys who swing from tree to tree.

In the New Adventures of Mowgli section, kids can select from a 3-part screen, some of which features live action digital video. Clicking on the moving feet icons and you can learn some facts about jungle animals on split-screen videos. There is a section of the game that is something of an interactive movie in that you can guide Mowgli as he travels through the jungle and find a cave which is the home of a villain that is so evil we never learn his name. The whole segment lacks speech and a story, and is mostly just a glorified tour of the jungle and its animals. Even so, it is an interactive movie since it is possible for Mowgli to get killed when he faces the villain which results in a bad ending for his adventure.

Construction and Management Simulation;Strategy	Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.As you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.There are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.Combat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.There are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.

Adventure	After a devastating atomic war, the world population was nearly annihilated, and the survivors had to hide deep underground. In the meantime, a peaceful race of human-like creatures, the boozooks, populated the Earth. After the humans ascended to the surface again, they started a bloody war against this race. The boozooks were mercilessly destroyed, their culture demolished, and in the end of the war they were enslaved by humans.The vertical, economically self-sufficient city of Vlurxtrznbnaxl was erected, controlled by a corrupt leader known as BigWig, who oppressed population with heavy taxes and freedom restrictions. The genius Professor Azimuth, sympathetic to the cause of the boozooks, has discovered a mysterious object or entity known as the Schnibble, which apparently could bring peace and prosperity to the world. However, BigWig's henchmen kidnap the professor and even shoot a teddy bear that belongs to his little adopted half-boozook son Woodruff. Applying a device called Viblefrotzer to himself, Woodruff physically ages fifteen years, and feels strong enough to begin a search for his foster father and find a way to dethrone BigWig.Woodruff is an adventure game with a cartoon-like appearance and many tricky puzzles, similar in art style and design to the Gobliiins series by the same creators. Unlike Gobliiins, this is a full-fledged adventure where the player character can move around freely, explore the large city, and interact with many characters. The interaction with the environment is done with a simple point-and-click system, without separate verb commands. The majority of the puzzles are inventory based; beside items, Woodruff can also use various spells (such as, for example, levitation) as well as ancient boozook formulae, which he has to learn and collect in order to advance in the game.

There are balls that move in one direction, sticky blocks that can pull obstacles out of the way, and five kinds of monsters that pursue Kye in real-time. Besides the monsters, some levels have blocks that are constantly in motion, so reflexes and skill are required in addition to problem solving. There is no gravity and no boulders to drop, and the levels, blocks and monsters are entirely original, so this isn't just another Boulder Dash clone. You can design your own custom levels, and a number of third-party level packs exist. Version 2.0 added five extra levels, black holes, one way doors, time bombs, an on-screen level editor, and registration now required a charitable donation to Save the Children, instead of direct payment to the author. There are 15 levels in the shareware version, and originally there were 20 extra levels in the registered version. User-created levels were added over the years, with a final tally of 496 extra levels in the registered version.				Single Player		false	76115482-97af-79a8-60f3-f3091c6f8b9d

Eventually he can take it no longer, and he hires a ship to search for the Land of the Green Isles located on the edge of the world. After months of searching he finally sets sight upon the island kingdom, only for a freak storm to strike the ship, destroying it and leaving him the only survivor. His troubles are far from over, however, as he soon finds out that the King and Queen have passed away, the Greens Isles are on the brink of war, and his beloved Princess Cassima may even be held prisoner by the royal vizier.Like its predecessors in the series, King's Quest VI: Heir Today, Gone Tomorrow is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. For Alexander to save the Isles, he must travel between the Land's four magical islands, each based on myth and fables, and encounter people and strange beasts that will either help or hinder him.

Imagine a unique story told in an unprecedented way. Developed by Xiphias, the company that introduced the first computer graphics system to be used in television news (KNXT in Los Angeles), Soft Kill is a unique techno-thriller based on the latest in hi-tech that explores the possibility of a world power using non-lethal warfare to bring the U.S. to its knees. Two politically opposed characters are thrown together in defense of the United States as a rogue element of the Japanese military attacks the Alaska Pipeline, the Panama Canal and the Malaccan Straits. The action explodes from a secret U.S. Navy base on Kauai to an ancient military shrine in Tokyo, from the North Shore of Alaska to the Palaces of Riayadh and the deep bowels of the United State's computer systems. Founded in a deep understanding of the vulnerability of the American infrastructure to attack and disruption, and the age-old attempts of governments to contest each other's territories of influence, this story combines high drama with photo-realistic imagery and video of secret places. The disk contains more than 70 digitized images and more than an hour of narration, which tell the story of what "nonlethal warfare" will be like in the not-so-distant future. Soft Kill owners can have the story told from different perspectives, including those of a narrator and the story's main characters. The innovative gameplay system consists of seven rows of ten cells each (called the Matrix), with four storytelling modes possible: Author (basic storytelling), Point-of-View (first-person views of varying subjects or subplots), Random (play sequences within each cell), and User (create your own path through the cells).

Once you choose a path, you're captivated with wild scenes such as stallions morphing into seahorses that turn in circles against the night sky. A mixture of poetry and sound complete the experience. text, read by a man and a woman, is taken from sources that include the Tibetan Book of the Dead, the Bible and the Bhagavad Gita.

Both the mini games and the full adventure have two levels of difficulty.Similarly to other educational games of the era, the player can interact with many things from the world, not necessarily pertaining to puzzles or story advancement. This can trigger animations or speeches, giving a better idea on what the object actually is. The protagonists' and other characters' lines are fully-voiced.

In 2000, it became a popular part of the Yahoo Games web portal playable in a JAVA format in a web browser.  Similar to Scrabble, the gameplay involves placing letters from 7 tiles per player on a board and trying to accumulate the highest score possible.  Letters are distributed to players randomly and are worth between 1 and 5 points while blank tiles (one which is always given in first 7 tiles of the game) have no point value but can be made into any letter.  The first word must be placed horizontally or vertically with one tile on the center square.  Subsequent words must use one letter of an existing word or be placed next to one so that any touching letters form valid words also.  Knowing the valid 2-letter words is very helpful in doing this.  Placing tiles on letter and word multiplier squares will increase your score and if you place all 7 tiles on the board at once, a 35-point bonus is given.  A player can also choose to pass and select any of the letters in their pile to trade for new ones but loses their turn.At player first creates a table and can change its options for number of players, put a time limit and whether it is unrated or rated (the outcome will affect a person's overall rating).  A challenge mode can also be set so that any word placed on the board can be challenged as to its validity by an opponent.  If it is invalid the word is removed and the player who put it down loses their turn or else the challenger loses their next turn if the word is indeed valid.  Other players choose to Join a table and press Start to begin a game.When all tiles in the game are distributed and one player places all their remaining ones on the board or no-one can play any more tiles then the game is over.  The sum of the letter values in each player's hand is subtracted from their score. If a player has no letters remaining, the sum of all of the letter values in the other players' hands are added to their score. The person with the highest score wins.

The story is told in considerably greater depth than the Disney version of a few years back, primarily because there's so much text and (therefore) so many more details. It is this preponderance of text – whether you're reading while listening to narration in "storybook mode", or just listening to narration in "movie" mode – that is the disc's greatest strength and fatal weakness. The simple, mostly black-and-white drawings and the pathetic excuses for animation (a flag that moves back and forth between two positions, to simulate waving in a breeze, is by no means a "movie") are disposable fluff. This storybook is really about using the computer, very straightforwardly, to read the story aloud while letting kids follow along. There's also some hypertext, offering words that will be briefly defined when clicked on.	Educational: Reading		E - Everyone	Single Player		false	84e23adc-761a-4a2f-30fd-fdf11cfa5a19

It has unleashed the powers of the Bions, warriors bred for battle and victory. After the war ended, Bions started their own war against Humanity... And humanity managed to win again, but Earth was decimated in the process. We thought we had destroyed all the Bions, but apparently we are wrong. A few Bions have survived... and they are rebuilding on the planet named Fury... As a councillor in Council of Peace, the premier peacekeeping force, you will take the advanced fighter and repel the Bion invasion, and eventually destroy the Bion threat once and for all. Fury│ is basically a Windows adaptation of Terminal Velocity where you pilot a super fighter and kill bazillion targets from first person (default) or third-person viewpoints. The action is fast and furious, with plenty of air and ground threats plus structures to shoot. The fighter sequences are interspersed with a bit of tunnel running (inspired by Descent, no doubt) and a lot of shooting. Shoot the weapon pods to release missiles and other goodies which you can use to supplement your own ship. The game is in full 3D without the need for a 3D video accelerator, though it only supports 320x200 resolution and preferably 256 color only.

Adventure	The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery is a direct sequel to Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers, the first in the supernatural mystery adventure series telling the story of a bookstore owner and writer Gabriel Knight, the last offspring of generations of Schattenjaegers (shadow hunters), whose task is to fight the evil forces that abound in the world.After leaving New Orleans, Gabriel moves to the Ritter Castle in Bavaria, Germany, his family heritage. One day, a group of peasants approach the castle, and the elder tells Gabriel about a terrible death of a little girl, who was killed by a vicious wolf. Suspecting the wolf could be a supernatural creature, the peasant asks the Schattenjaeger to purge the evil. The investigation brings Gabriel and his assistant Grace Nakimura to the mysterious Hunter Society and to Bavaria's dark past.The game utilizes a cast of live actors and full-motion video technology: the actors are filmed over photorealistic images of Munich and its surroundings, and nearly every interaction with the environment leads to a FMV sequence. Despite its visual style, The Beast Within is not an interactive movie, but a full-fledged adventure game with many dialogues, detective work to do, and puzzles to solve. Unlike the first game, it is entirely controlled through point-and-click actions - all the icons have been replaced by a single cursor.

No one important remains - the rich and powerful leave, and those who cannot are relegated to a seedy, backwater existence amid the incessantly howling, eerie winds of the decaying megalopolis. Outside contact is minimal. From time to time the Corporation sends out a ship to ensure its interests are maintained, and even more rarely Thalissar is visited by the Sinkhas who are immortal beings who maintain benign order in the net of aligned worlds. They travel aboard the living starship Darcon, and each has the guise of one of the races that inhabit the net worlds. Mortals fear to look upon them, but Hyleyn seeks them out, desperate to plead for her escape from Thalissar. She has also fallen in love with a Sinkha, the silver-haired Aker. Her wish is granted and she is shuttled to the Darcon, where she experiences virtual tableaux of beauty and peace, richly colored, clean and soothing. For the first time in her life she also hears quiet, finally away from the mysterious, maddening winds of Thalissar. Her newfound peace is shortlived however, as the Darcon moves to investigate unusual readings on the planet's surface and the incomprehensible crash of a Corporation ship at the source of these signals. Sinkha is a visually stunning work that braids multimedia features tightly with the graphic novel concept. It is baroquely detailed, lavishly textured and generously lathered with realistic animation and 3-D. The score is digital in flavor and the sound effects well chosen - the viscous lap of detritus-laden waters on metal, the drone of high powered winds and dynamos. Although visually complex, the actual story is muddled and hackneyed, degrades quickly and the characters have about as much emotional depth as sock puppets. However, this production is fabulous because the artistic and design elements are so strong (if a bit derivative of H.R. Giger).

It's a game of global domination, like Risk, except that there are no cards to award bonus armies. Each player represents an ideology – Populist, Militarist, Socialist or Realist. The world is divided into 139 nations, each of which supports one of the players' ideologies. When you conquer a nation that supports your ideology, they greet you as liberators and require only 1 army to hold them, whereas nations that support rival ideologies need additional armies to remain in order to prevent a revolution. Armies are awarded at the beginning of each turn based on the number of nations held, plus bonus armies for holding an entire continent. World Empire II adds an "all nations conquered" option, in addition to the "all nations neutral" starting position of the original. Populations and national capitals are now listed for each country. Starting with v1.5, the game became "Deluxe" because it adds a real world simulation mode to the registered version, in which population and development are taken into account. Version 1.5 also adds an option to have all sides start with 30 armies instead of 56, and to check the status of all countries on the continent. The shareware version can be played by one to four players, with up to two computer players (one in v1.0).

In their successful attempt to oust the Iraqi army from Kuwait (being careful to leave Saddam in power) through an overwhelming display of power, the coalition of the West in operation Desert Storm soon found their grizzled opponents only too eager to surrender and save their hides.  This program commemorates their efforts, indicating a line of happily compliant soldiers, alive, in mental contrast to the stilled parade of "crispy critters" along the turkey shoot of the Highway of Death back to Basra.To drive home the point of what a straw man the opposing forces ended up being, the program runs through to completion upon execution without any input needed from the player; however, if the author was more prescient, he might have instructed the program to lie dormant for twelve years and then fire up some horrifying no-win program like Forbidden.exe or Punishment for what John McCain suggests might be ten thousand years.

The game can be played at one of the 10 levels - the higher the level, the faster the tiles move.There are two game modes: the "Single Level Shuffle", where the player chooses the level he wishes to play on, and has an opportunity to make 20 guesses (correct or not) before the game ends; and the "Progressive Level Shuffle", which is based on the same rules, but the level increases with each successful guess and decreases with each failure.After each guess, the player can see an instant replay of the tiles re-arranging, but in slow motion and with the tiles revealed.

The middle grid allows you to choose what area you will attack during your turn. The right grid displays your own Sats, their status, and the places where the opponent has already attacked. This continues until one side loses all their Sats.The main difference between the Battleship board game and this Windows-based implementation is that there are five Sat pieces in play, all different sizes. While the board game has two pieces that are two blocks in size, this version contains one piece that's two blocks in size, and one piece that's one block in size.

The games are all controlled with the mouse, and all have the same theme of aliens and outer space. The graphics are colorful and cartoony, and the arcade action is designed to be non-violent and kid-friendly. Each game has its own highscore table.[13][10][13][10]Ctrl-P is used to pause a game, Ctrl-A to stop playing the current game and choose another one to play, and Ctrl-Q to quit Alien Arcade altogether. The games run at 640x480 pixel resolution, but only a 512x342 pixel region of the screen is used for the games. Outside this is a static border featuring background art (such as the surface of a planet, or the inside of a spaceship) which changes randomly each time you play.[13][10][13][10]There are six games in the collection.[13][10]Andromedroids: in this game you build up robots one piece at a time, by dropping them into one of seven assembly bins. There is also a recycle bin for dropping unused parts, and a special bug bin for dropping Mercurian Metal Bugs that may appear. Dropping the bugs in any other bin will cause damage to your robot parts.[13][10][13][10]Fungus Patrol: you control a ship in the middle of the screen that can only rotate, but if you click the mouse, the ship shoots out in a straight line on a bungee cord, touches the edge of the screen, then snaps back to the center. Green fungus encroaches in on you from the edges of the screen, and you clear it up by hitting it with your ship, which has a big suction nozzle on the front of it. The fungus can damage your bungee cord, and if it is completely eaten away, the game is over.[13][10][13][10]Nerdoids: you control a ship at the bottom of the screen that can only move left and right, and shoots comic books. Moving across the screen, on multiple levels, are orange aliens wearing glasses. If you hit an alien with a comic book, they will start reading it. If you hit an alien already reading a comic book with another comic book, they drop the one they are holding. The aim is to have all aliens still be reading a comic book when they leave the screen. The aliens will also randomly drop calculators and pocket protectors, that can subtract 5 comic books from your arsenal if they hit you.[13][10][13][10]Quasar Klutzes: you control a ship at the bottom of the screen that can only move left and right, and shoots bananas. There are blue aliens walking back and forth on multiple levels. The aliens are clumsy and will either slip on bananas, or two aliens may collide trying to grab the same banana. They will then start falling towards the bottom of the screen, but if they hit your ship while falling you lose 5 bananas. Your goal is to cause all the aliens to fall. There is also a robot dog that sometimes appears, and drops clouds of gas that subtract 2 bananas from your ship if they hit you.[13][10][13][10]Quasar Rain: this game takes place "underneath" Quasar Klutzes. Blue aliens and banana peels are raining down from the top of the screen, and you control a spring-loaded platform that slides left and right at the bottom of the screen. When an alien hits you, they are flung over to a wall of bunk beds on the left side of the screen. The aim is to avoid letting 3 aliens fall off the bottom of the screen (although the instructions assure us that the fallen aliens will be caught by a safety net, just off-screen) and also to avoid the banana peels, as they lose you points.[13][10][13][10]Stink Snakes of Saturn: you control a ship on the left edge of the screen that can only move up and down, and shoots pies. Yellow snakes appear from the right and slither towards you. If you hit a snake with a pie, it turns into a smiley face, that you can collect for a point bonus. You have a limited number of pies.

1291w	YellowBr	Yellow Brick Road (1996).zip	379291347	Yellow Brick Road	1996	Synergy Inc.	Synergy Interactive Corp.	Adventure;Strategy	Inspired by the Oz Books by L. Frank Baum, Yellow Brick Road concerns the player's attempt to thwart an invasion of the Emerald City by the Gnome King. Along the way s/he teams up with the tin man, lion, and eventually the scarecrow. Besides these, other recognizable figures from the books include Jack Pumpkinhead, the little Wizard of Oz, and Glinda, who, in the game, is queen of Oz. The game's structure is reminiscent of first-person adventures: the player interacts with the environment and manipulates inventory items to proceed. The puzzles, however, are kept to a minimum, since combat occupies a significant portion of the game, effectively turning it into a hybrid of adventure and small-scale real-time strategy.Battles usually occur as dictated by the plot. The player does not fight directly, but instead acts as a general to his/her companions. Each character has a quick but weak base attack or can use one of the items found throughout the game. Many of the items act differently depending on who uses them. For instance, the flute calls field mice into battle for the Tin Woodman, while it calls crows into battle for the Scarecrow.  The more powerful the item, the longer the downtime for the character who has used it before he can fight again. The enemies progress toward the companions' side of the battlefield at a constant pace.  If they reach them, the battle is lost, and the player must try again.  If instead the player manages to push them back off the far side of the field, the battle is won and the game progresses. Different enemies are more greatly affected by different weapon/character combinations, and immune against some.	Theme: Fantasy		Not Rated	Single Player		false	32b33c64-2c2e-20de-7f44-44d38373ef14

Construction and Management Simulation;Simulation	SimTown is one of several entries in the city-building simulation series, SimCity. As in prior installments, players are tasked as the mayor of a newly formed municipality, taking charge of it's expansion and success. Being aimed at a younger audience than that of the other games within the series a greater emphasis is placed on managing a small, socially ideal town than a sprawling metropolis. As such it features a much more stylized, cartoon representation and user interface, a number of added features allowing for greater interactivity with the populace, and a simplified system of resource management.As their first priority as mayor players will simply need to construct a town, supplying not only housing for their residents but employment, schools, and civic buildings as well; Roadways and bike paths being needed to connect them all. While each building has its own associated costs and benefits they're often marginal enough that a player's selection will often be as much an aesthetic consideration as a functional one. In order to finance all of this consideration will also have to be paid to the player's limited resources of water, wood, and crops, which rejuvenate only so quickly.Interacting with the populace will also be crucial to success. Individual citizens will often offer suggestions and make demands of the mayor and so a close eye will have to be kept on their opinions of how the city is being run. Those that favor specific types of restaurants will request them and objections will be made if the city is lacking in their preferred form of recreation. Players can also take a closer look at their residents by 'removing' the tops of buildings and peering inside, watching their life unfold on a more minute scale. Specially constructed designer characters can also be made to populate the town, built to pre-defined specifications such as their preferred clothing and personal preferences.A number of awards can be gained within the game for exemplary achievements resulting from maintaining a balanced town for some period of time. An in-game newspaper will assist in these efforts by helping to keep the player up to date on what might be wrong in their city, or how they might be succeeding.

1093w	Civ3x	Sid Meier's Civilization (1993).zip	93991688	Sid Meier's Civilization	1993	MPS Labs	MicroProse Software, Inc.	Construction and Management Simulation;Strategy	Civilization has the widest scope of any strategy game of its time. You are a leader of a nation. You begin in the Stone Age, and complete the game in the XXIth century (unless your civilization gets destroyed earlier). Your eventual goal is to become the dominant civilization in the world, either by wiping out everybody else, or being the first to get a space ship to Alpha Centauri.As the nation's leader, you have many responsibilities. You have to build cities, and then micromanage them, constructing various buildings. Most of people in your cities will be working on the neighbouring lands to get food (without it, your city won't survive or grow), production (used to build military units and buildings) and trade (which can be exchanged for money, science (see below) or luxuries that make people happy. You decide how much trade you want to invest into each of these areas.) You have to make sure that your people are in a good mood; if they get too unhappy, the city will collapse into disorder, and won't produce anything until you fix the situation. If you're ambitious, you can build Wonders of the World - epic constructions, such as the Pyramids or the Hoover Dam. Each Wonder is an unique thing, and only one of each can exist in the world. They give you a lot of benefits if you complete them, but they take a long time to build, and many of them will eventually stop working. There are other nations in the world, and there are also barbarians, so you'll have to invest into the military to protect yourself and to attack. Sure, you can sign peace treaties with other nations, and even exchange scientific knowledge with them (although sometimes they'll demand tribute from you), but eventually you'll probably have to fight. You control each of your military units on the world map, attacking your opponents' units and cities (possibly taking over them). Not all units are for combat though. Settlers are used to build cities, create roads (for easier travel of your units) and improve the land around cities, increasing production. Diplomats can be sent to foreign cities to negotiate with the other nations or create embassies, but they can also bribe enemy units to join you and conduct espionage and sabotage in the enemies' cities. Caravans can be sent to faraway cities to increase trade in their home city, and they can also help in building Wonders of the World. Scientific progress is an important part of the game. The more science your cities produce, the faster you research new technologies. Initially, you'll be finding out about the wonders of Alphabet or Bronze Working, but late in the game you'll be researching Computers and Robotics. Most technologies give you some new units, buildings and other things, although some have more interesting effects - for example, after inventing the Automobile, you'll find out that your citizens started producing pollution. Pollution is a bad thing; if there's too much of it, global warming may occur. How your cities prosper depends partially on the type of government that your nation has. Initially you're living in Despotism, but this can stunt growth of your civilization, so it's a good idea to switch to something else - Monarchy, Republic, Democracy or Communism.

Iwai's original, Music Insects is a very popular permanent exhibit at the Exploratorium in San Francisco.[13][10][13][10]SimTunes is an interactive 'painting/music/simulation' game. The user paints colored squares on a virtual grid, where each color maps to a tone in a musical scale. Then the user unleashes four little 'bugz' to roam around on the painted grid. Each bugz has an instrument or vocal style associated with it, and when it walks over one of the squares of light it 'plays' its sound at that tone. The user can control the scale, the instruments, and the speed and direction of the bugz, creating an interactive musical experience.

It feels like you’ve stumbled into an excavation site. The doorways are carved out of stone, and the exhibits about gemstones and ores are built into the rock walls. As you walk around, you can hear water dripping. Where an actual museum might have a famous sculpture or a dinosaur skeleton in the center of the room, this museum has the earth’s core, shrunken-down, sitting on a pedestal and lighting up its surroundings.[13][10][13][10]Owing to their art experience, all of Dorling Kindersley’s CD-ROMs look terrific, but Earth Quest is especially spectacular. The museum is monumental. Even though it has a small footprint, it thinks in terms of hulking earthworks and geography. There are a few side exhibits, like a Violent Earth pavilion about earthquakes and volcanoes, and they’re presented on the edge of cliffs overlooking giant expanses of the earth. The balcony of the Shaping the Earth exhibit overlooks a view that moves between mountains, deserts, valleys, and islands to illustrate land formation. This is a museum so enormous and grandiose that the planet itself is on display.	Educational: Science; Eyewitness Virtual Reality series			Single Player		false	c9bf3650-5166-45d9-a2ae-6d85d7a49e62

Life Simulation	Oddballz is a spin-off from the Catz and Dogz series, from P.F. Magic.[13][10][13][10]This time, as the title states, the pets are wacky creatures, more alien-like than animal. Now they can make their eyes come out of their sockets and literally scare them to pieces, while retaining a comic look and feel (something impossible while dealing with Dogz or Catz).[13][10][13][10]The mechanics are pretty much the same in every game of the series, and here the player also gets to pet them, teach them tricks, punish them or just play around. The Oddballz will respond to each and every move and they can even morph into to something else, depending on what the player does.[13][10][13][10]The tools the player can use are also very different from the ones in Dogz and Catz, and also have a wacky feel to them. There are tools like the Robo Pogo, the Gravitron, Seismo Ball, Transformer, Atomic Ball, and the delicious Liqui-Food, for feeding the pets.[13][10][13][10]The company also made additional Oddballz available for download from their site, to add to the starting lot of seven.

The player can choose to trim horizontal or vertical segments -- depending on which axis they expect the bouncing ball to intercept soonest -- and the boring apparatus used fires off in opposite directions simultaneously, meaning the cross-section generally starts being cut from the middle and works its way toward the outside edges... all while keeping an eye on how close those balls are bouncing.The apparatus is slow, and until the entire cross-section is completed, its entire span is at risk of being hit.  The two sides of the dividing sweep are independent from each other, so if one side is intercepted by a ball while in the process of trimming, the other side continues unabated, resulting in a half-complete division.This game became famous after being distributed as part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 4 of Windows 3.x games, returning in the Best of Microsoft Entertainment Pack.

Some games are traditional, such as Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Reversi, or the card game Go Fish.Others are renamed versions of popular games. "Remember!" is basically Concentration, a memory game. "The Cheese King" is Hangman, while the "On-Ramps & Off Ramps" is the board game chutes & ladders. "Word Hunt!" is the device in puzzle books where you find words in letter grids. In "Guess It!", you use logic to figure out which fruits are used and which locations they've been placed in. "Lines & Boxes"  is another logic game, making boxes by drawing lines between a grid of dots.Finally, Tangrams is a spatial recognition game, fitting pieces into different shapes. Most of these games have multiple difficulty levels. Although designed for children 3-8, many of the games should give even parents the occasional run-for-the-money at the Hardest level.Finally, there are four games just for fun: In "Circus Stormin'" - a side-scrolling arcade game - you control Putt-Putt up and down, moving him around obstacles and having him pick up balloons. There's also a sliding tiles (logic puzzle) game with slightly varying images, and a Pachinko pinball where you can create your own 'field' of 6x11 bumpers and the balls make amusing sounds when they hit.

Each character, according to The Residents, has the Gingerbread Man in them somewhere, represented in the music by the Gingerbread Man theme: Run, run, as fast as you can You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man. Each of the songs have the same general format: a 30-second introduction (which usually features the Gingerbread Man theme) followed by a verse sung by the character, and then a mix of comments and thoughts by the character over music which expands on the themes in the verse, given the listener glimpses into the person's thoughts.

Your task is to guide the green python through various scrolling levels and eat all mice in each of them. However, the mice are often scattered around the level, so you have to search for them first. With each eaten mouse, Paulie grows a bit, making it more difficult to avoid his own tail. You must neither crash into the tail nor the walls, otherwise you will lose a life. Another hazard you might encounter are white balls that bounce around and kill your character when they hit his head. Keep in mind that Paulie's tail stays the same size when you advance to the next level. The same happens when Paulie dies and has to restart a level, while all previously eaten mice reappear. This means that the python grows to an enormous size during the course of the game.	Snake variants			Single Player		false	08cc6c8c-5b3c-1f0e-926c-6cf7304813fd

The player follows the adventure of Artaud, a disgraceful French Lord, who is sent to redeem himself by traveling to the Holy Lands to escort the True Cross back to safety. This is done through a series of scenes, with narration. The player has to complete certain tasks before Artaud can progress to the next scene. These tasks are generally of an educational nature, such as learning how sieges on castles were carried out, or who the main forces in the Holy Lands were at the time. Whilst Artaud's quest is fictional (with some added supernatural events), the setting is quite real, with actual locations visited and use of historic figures.Artaud's quest will see his home in Dun-le-Roy wasted in a siege, travel across the Mediterranean to the port of Acre, and eventually to the Holy City of Jerusalem. Along the way historical information is provided on events and lifestyles of the period.The game's style has a 3rd-person perspective and uses digital footage of real actors again photo-realistic (for the time) backdrops, which are partially animated. Intertwined with the scenes is an encyclopaedia, which it is necessary to interact with in order to complete the tasks and fully understand the narrative. The structure of most of the tasks involves collecting items from the scenes and the encyclopaedia by dragging them into your inventory, and then re-arranging them on to the task screen. The game is very similar in style to 1998's Vikings.	Educational: History		Not Rated	Single Player	Crusader - Adventure Out of Time (1997).pdf	false	6593e84c-c4f1-1b7c-3887-8788ef18ad03

931w	MCelePkr	Multimedia Celebrity Poker (1995).zip	696940838	Multimedia Celebrity Poker	1995	New World Computing, Inc.	New World Computing, Inc.	Cards / Tiles	Heartfelt, but rather unrealistic wishes like ruling the world, unlimited processing power or an evening playing poker with three celebrities usually fall into the sphere of competence of a fairy. In case one happens to show up in your home: donÆt ask for that poker game. ThatÆs already been taken care of, thanks to New World Computing. NWC-mastermind Jon Van Caneghem invited three class B TV celebrities of the mid-90s for a day of green-screen filming. The result is called Multimedia Celebrity Poker.If youÆre into TV series, then youÆll probably have no trouble recognizing the faces of your opponents. Sitting at the poker table are Jonathan äRikerô Frakes (Star Trek: Next Generation), appearing somewhat tight-lipped; talkative comedian Joe Piscopo (Saturday Night Live), showing off his array of impersonations; and aging starlet Morgan Fairchild (Hotel, Falcon Crest), sitting stiff and generally trying not to look too lost. Digitized video clips, seamlessly integrated into the main frame, depict all actions and movements of the stars -- dealing, calling, playing cards. Separate clips for the three actors are played simultaneously to avoid äfreezingô of single persons; all are continuously in motion. The celebrities comment on the their cards and your success to create a relaxed and intimate atmosphere. The number of different statements is quite limited though; prepare to learn those one-liners by heart.Multimedia Celebrity Poker knows eight different variants of poker. You may play combinations of five cards or seven, stud or draw, lo-ball or high, deuces wild or normal. In any case, itÆs always you against the computer; a multiplayer option is not included. In addition to a relaxed round among friends, you can choose to advance levels in a tournament. You win if all opponents are broke, although nobody will undress at that point. Luckily. The programÆs poker skill is mediocre; itÆs playing fairly straight, rarely risking a bluff. The playing style of the three celebrities does not differ.Ready to join the game? On second thought, maybe you should wait for the fairy.	Genre: Card / Tile game - Poker			Single Player		false	e3f9513c-b5d2-5ac8-9b5c-5c999f059c5f

1130w	SoliTwin	Solitaire Twin Pack (1995).zip	27300447	Solitaire Twin Pack	1995	Irene Smith	Personal Companion Software	Cards / Tiles	Solitaire Twin Pack contains two card games, Pyramid Solitaire and Golf Solitaire.Pyramid Solitaire : In this game the cards are arranged in a pyramid and the object is to remove cards totalling 13 until all cards have been removed. In this game each card has a value starting with the Ace which counts as 1 through to the King which counts as 13. The object is to make 13 points i order to remove cards from play so at 13 points Kings can be removed as soon as they become available but Aces must be paired with Queens, 2's with Jacks, e.t.c. Each card removed will make available the card above it in the pyramid. When a player runs out of moves to make they may draw another card from the deck and try to use that card to form a match. The game concludes when all the cards have been removed from the pyramid or when no more moves are possible.Golf Solitaire : This may be played as a single hand or as a series of nine hands or holes in the game terminology.  The player starts each 'hole' with a score of 35 points, that's the number of cards that are on the table. One point is deducted for each card removed from the table. The object in each 'hole' is to clear all the cards from the table. The object of each game, as in a round of golf, is to finish with as low a score as possible. Card suits are irrelevant in this game. The player removes cards from the table by putting together sequences of cards starting with the card turned over. A sequence is made by playing a card from the table that is numerically one different from the card that's in play. Thus if a 5 were turned over the player could play any available 6 or any available 4 because these numbers are next in sequence. Once the 6 or 4 is played the turn continues until there are no more cards to be added to the sequence at which point the next card is turned over.    Both games are played with the mouse and come with in-game help text, and the ability to change the pattern on the back of the cards. Only Pyramid Solitaire has an Undo function and only Golf Solitaire has a Save Game option.

A typical full-motion video game of the nineties, it features 360║ horizontal panning of some locations and easy puzzles for its target audience (mostly comprised of children).Published and produced by the computer game branch of the documentary channel Discovery, the focus is obviously on didactic elements: a small scientific facts database is integrated as a button to the interface, and can be accessed at any moment in the game. It plays animations and videos of hurricanes and other weather phenomena. It also contains clues to the solution of some of the puzzles. In an effort to further dispel any attempt at any meaningful amount of challenge, a hint button is provided on the interface at the bottom, placed between the inventory and the volume control and a compass.Gameplay is the standard fare of this type of game: instead of Myst's focus on mechanical puzzles, most are inventory-based. There are some short arcade sequences that need to be completed to advance the game.	Educational: Science; Theme: Sci-Fi		Not Rated	Single Player		false	ac17b9c0-eb12-a698-abed-ed384160712c

The game starts with each player placing a bet or "Ante" in the treasure chest lid area of the table. The cards are then dealt, all the player(s) cards are dealt face down but the top card of the dealers hand is placed face up. Each player in turn decides whether their hand will beat the dealers.

In addition there is a progressive bonus payout for hands that contain a flush or better.The game allows the player to change various settings such as the speed of the deal, the minimum & maximum bet and to set automatic reminders for the progressive bet and other gaming situations.

There are many variants, but here is the principle: the game is usually played with three persons. Two of the players are playing against a single one, but are not allowed to communicate. Each card has a value and one suit is called "Trumpf". In every round each player loses one of his cards and the one who played the "Trumpf" card with the highest value gets all the played cards. If no "Trumpf" is played, the highest value wins. At the end each player counts the value of his cards. The goal for the single player is to get more points than the other two combined.[13][10][13][10]The main feature of Skat 3000 is the integration of many local skat variants. If your favorite rule set is not included you can create it yourself with the freely adjustable rules. It also has a tutorial, animated graphics and voice acting. In comparison to Skat 2095 it features more opponents and a better playing AI. In the shareware version are several restrictions present, e.g. no adjustable rules and no save option.

From Arnold's head to his toe, the group travels through every system, including the Upper and Lower Digestive System, the Circulatory System, the Respiratory System, Liver, Nervous System and the skin. Only when all the areas and 12 body parts have been visited can the class leave Arnold's body through one of three natural exits.All actions in this game are performed with the mouse.

Once the bus is selected, the journey begins as the miniaturized vehicle zooms into Arnold's mouth. The player navigates through his body by clicking the steering wheel and selecting directional signs from the bus windshield; each place will lead to at least one other, and all lead to the nervous system from where any section can be visited. On the lower left sits Liz, the class mascot, who can be clicked for help. Clicking the rear view mirror takes the player to the back of the bus, where he can choose Tim's knapsack to access a drawing program, or Ralphie's handheld to play a game related to the current body part. As the player journeys through the body the places he has visited are recorded on a map in the glove box as well as stamped in a travel log, so he can see what has been missed.

Bubbles, which are constantly rising from deep within the whirlpool, will force the water level down if they are allowed to reach the water's surface.  If the water level becomes too low, Luther will have to retry the level, minus one energy level.  To prevent this from happening, Luther must use his trusty slingshot and unlimited supply of ammo to pop the bubbles before they reach the surface.  Luther also needs to be careful when navigating the whirlpool, since running into a bubble may render him momentarily trapped and unable to fire his slingshot.

Infogrames	Adventure;Education	Pilgrim is an adventure game set in the Middle Ages after the Crusades during the 13th century. It is the time of the Knights Templar, the Black Plague and the Inquisition when many were tortured and burned at the stake because of their religious beliefs.Summoned to his father's side, Simon (your character) is told that he must obtain a valuable manuscript in a secret room and deliver it only to Petrus, a friend who lives in Toulouse. His pleading hints that this mission might be dangerous, but Simon agrees even though he doesn't understand. Shortly thereafter, his father dies. The interaction begins in the library as you start Simon's adventure.This is a first person, point and click game with a somewhat unconventional interface. The inventory contains objects which can be used as well as clicked on during conversations. Icons of the people Simon has met or heard about also act as conversation topics when clicked on. The game features an in-game hint system which provides very vague clues to the many puzzles Simon will encounter. A comprehensive encyclopedia is accessible at any time to document and elaborate upon the historical facts of the era and to the game itself. Angels, demons and people from all walks of life will help (or hinder) Simon's progress towards his goals as he travels around France's towns and countryside. Locations are varied with marketplaces, villages, a ruined fortress, gothic churches and, later, fanciful environments. Puzzles include several mechanical problems, helping other characters with objects and information as well as creative environment manipulation.

1933w	CJPandW	Chuck Jones - Peter and the Wolf (1994).zip	275672248	Chuck Jones: Peter and the Wolf	1994	IF/Xi Interactive	Time Warner Interactive	Visual Novel	Letting legendary Warner Bros. animator Chuck Jones try his hand at CD-ROM animation is a little like asking Eric Clapton to let rip on a ukulele. The genius who helped create the Road Runner and some of Daffy Duck’s career highs here illustrates the Prokofiev kiddie classic, with voices provided by Kirstie Alley and Lloyd Bridges. But while Jones’ Chuck Jones’ Peter and the Wolf has a certain paranoid Wile E. Coyote charm, the limits of computer memory make for jerky movement and overly long pauses. An excellent learn-about-the-orchestra section is marred by kludgy text-scrolling, and I’m not sure what Prokofiev would have made of the ”Log Jam Game,” in which the user helps Peter cross a river by moving him from log to log (has Jones been watching Ren & Stimpy?). This is a fine amusement for kids, but you’ll want them to listen to the audio CD that comes with it, if only so they can experience this music unfettered by technology.

As an added bonus, Origin FX includes a module that plays the cinematic sequences when Wing Commander II is installed on your hard drive.

Action;Strategy	Inner Space is an arcade-style shooter taking place inside a rather familiar environment: the player's computer. Evil forces have invaded, seizing control of the player's system, and setting loose program icons to cause mayhem. It's up to the player to round up the renegade icons, all the while battling other hazards inside the inner space of the player's computer, and working with--or fighting--the other AI-controlled pilots that populate the system.The game builds its gameworld dynamically from the contents of the player's hard drive, so the game never plays exactly the same way twice. There are racetracks, a dueling arena where the player can settle scores with rivals without interference from the IS Enforcers, and a strange Inner Demon whom the player must ultimately learn to defeat in order to win the game. The player can select from dozens of ships and their variations to play, or create them using the Ship Factory, and upgrade the player's ship capabilities with weapons and equipment bought from the ambulance or salvaged from destroyed ships. The game also includes a screen saver.			Not Rated	Single Player		false	da47b529-2415-3d62-2dc6-c60437215f16

Education	In this first game in the series, Ms. Frizzle is lost as soon as the bus flies off into space and the goal of the game is to locate her using the clues she provides. This is essentially a computer version of the book The Magic School Bus Lost in the Solar System and the cartoon episode "The Magic School Bus Lost in Space,". The Friz's hiding place varies throughout the game. As would become the standard for the remainder of the games in the original software series, the main screen consists of the bus's dashboard, where the user can "drive" the bus to any of the nine planets or Earth's moon. Since Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune lack solid surfaces, the bus instead lands on one of their moons (Io for Jupiter, Mimas for Saturn, Miranda for Uranus and Triton for Neptune.) Once on a planet, the user can exit the bus, where a strange satellite called the "whatsit" must be clicked on to bring up an arcade-styled game in which the user, controlling one of the students, must collect one of Ms. Frizzle's tokens (giant coins with Ms. Frizzle's face on them) which provide the user with a clue as to the Friz's whereabouts and activate the "Friz-finder." There are only three clues available, but tokens will still need to be collected to activate the "Friz-finder" after all the clues have been exhausted. Clicking on the "Friz-finder" will determine whether Ms. Frizzle is anywhere on the current planet. If she is, then the game is completed, but if she is not then the user will have to collect another token to activate the "Friz-finder" to try again. There are also a bunch of different surprises, including a singing barbershop group of rocks called "the Cratertots".

Since they are a common sight and fairly harmless, people do not worry about them, but a mysterious substance known as Goop changes the monsters' character drastically.[13][10][13][10]MEI brings in the freelancers Mortis "The Skullcracker" Rigor and Penelope "Bonebreaker" Jones to bring back order.

Some of the places visited are a shopping mall, an arcade, the graveyard, a playground, the MEI headquarters, and more. Next to moving, jumping, and climbing, they can punch and kick opponents, and use power-ups such as flare guns, flame throwers or supersoakers filled with holy water to take out enemies, while replenishing health with pick-ups.

The game features 16 bit stereo, surround music and sound effects, and graphic art  (full screen 3D). You can even "explore" the CD as a music CD....The game can  be played in one of two modes :  1) "Challenging" (you have to find everything that is to be found), or ... 2) "Explore" where keys are given - and you "just" have to look for the doors...

Adventure;Detective / Mystery	Gabriel Knight is a wise-cracking bookstore owner and would-be author. He is the last in a long line of Shadow Hunters, those fated to fight supernatural forces of evil. Tormented by terrifying nightmares, he must spend every waking moment scouring the side streets and back alleys of New Orleans for the key to his dark past. One day, a blood-chilling murder shocks the inhabitants of the city. The police detective assigned to investigate the crime is Gabriel's friend. In the beginning Gabriel collects evidence in hope of using the material for his new novel; but soon he finds himself personally involved in the investigation, and plunges deeper into the world of secret societies and murderous cults.Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers is a third-person puzzle-solving adventure game. Created by Jane Jensen, the game differs from Sierra's Quest games (e.g. Space Quest) by having a realistic setting and focusing (despite its supernatural elements and humor) on mature themes and detective work. In this way it is more similar to the company's earlier Laura Bow games. The game's icon-based interface is the same as in Sierra's previous titles, with verb commands that allow interaction with the game world and its inhabitants. Though the game still has plenty of inventory-based puzzles characteristic for classic adventure, its gameplay is heavily inclined towards dialogue. Typically, Gabriel will have to interrogate other characters, choosing conversation topics and thus gradually finding clues and advancing towards the mystery's solution.The game's locations are done in hand-painted style. The CD version of the game adds full voice-overs to the dialogues, as well as narrator's voice to text descriptions.

In twelve stories that pulsate and migrate across the screen, narrator Jim Petrillo considers the strange lives of great inventors of the nineteenth century: Alessandro Volta, Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Samuel Morse, and Nicola Tesla. But don't expect a dry treatise on the history of science. Petrillo's idiosyncratic perspective takes in the history of Sicily; Shelley and Byron's shenanigans during the summer of 1816 (Byron's daughter, Ada, wrote the first computer program); Joyce's X-rated love letters to Nora (the program takes its name from a movie theater opened by Joyce in Trieste in 1909); the cave paintings of Lascaux; Frankenstein; naked people; vampires; big noise; and the artist's own childhood memories. Often ironic (electricity was first used, he notes, to make dead frogs twitch), Petrillo's commentary weaves together an arresting collage of images and text. The subtitle promises "Weird Science and Childhood Memories." Weird it is, and not for everyone. But like any cult favorite, it has its fans.

However, following the Darkfall, the jagtera have disappeared from the island. The quality of life on Phoros has drastically declined, and its nobles came up with a monstrous plan: spreading rumors about the return of jagtera, they poisoned the population with a nectar that turned them into vicious, uncontrollable replicas of these gentle creatures.

It narrates the adventures of Ninja Nanny, a mischievous cow in search of her heritage, and her companion Sherrlock Sheltie. The story leads to animated sequences that introduce a host of unusual fiends and foes as Baron Von Moribund trails Ninja Nanny through San Francisco, London, and the Cotswolds. "No. 11 Downing St. uses sidebars to emphasize clues to the overall mystery of Ninja Nanny's heritage, give local color to a scene, or develop more richly the emerging relationship between the two main characters. The text contains hot-words and phrases that link to the DictioPedia which explains words, ideas, and settings. No. 11 Downing St. is full of double entendres and puns, as you would expect from a company that calls itself Silicon Alley. Graphics often resemble turn-of-the-century clip art. Clicking on various objects causes items to move and entertain the user. For example, clicking on the bumper stop of a loading dock in chapter three reveals that it reads 'The truck stops here - H. Truman, Postmaster.' Looking up Truman in the DictioPedia indicates that he once went bankrupt and served heroically in World War I. One can see footage of the war and then see one of Truman's most trying moments, firing General Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War. The user can also see MacArthur make his famous 'I shall return' speech.

Each level is a puzzle room filled with obstacles and viewed from above, where the objective is to use a series of mirrors to guide a laser beam towards a receiver device and complete the stage. The mirrors are stationary, but can be rotated to deflect the light to several directions, with some turning automatically all the time. The player must configure the mirrors and carefully avoid the mines and walls that reflect the laser back to itself, causing the emitting device to overload and explode. Bomb detonators have to be activated and destroyed to open a passage to the receiver. Other features change the behavior of the laser: the prism bends the light in random 90║ angles; the optical fiber nodes act as a portals, transporting the beam to another place of the board; logical doors have internal mirrors that absorb or deflect the laser when hit at the correct orientation.

Action;Pinball	In 1893, an English archaeologist called Sir Evangel finds a strange stone in a London antiquary. The galopetra ("milk stone") has a hieroglyphic and a maze carved on one side, and a Minotaur on the reverse. Intrigued, he travels to Crete and starts to explore the newly discovered Knossos ruins. Searching the labyrinth, he stumbles upon a time machine, dubbing it the "Loony Machine". He leaves instructions at the site on how the device works, for future explorers willing to travel to 2000 years in the past and assume the role of Theseus, the slayer of the Minotaur.[13][10][13][10]Loony Labyrinth is the 4th pinball simulator created by LittleWing. It has one table with classic proto-Greek mythological themes. As an explorer and later as the legendary hero Theseus, the objective is to first find and activate the time machine, and then go back to ancient times and defeat the Minotaur.[13][10][13][10]In the first part, the goal is to collect all the five galopetra stones and install them to activate the machine. The ball has to hit drop targets near the stone ramp to make one of the STONE light letters start flashing. One stone is collected by sending the ball up the ramp while the light is blinking. Getting all the stones awards five million points. To install them, the ball has to hit several times the energy charger bumper, raising the energy level to 100% and turning on the install hole.[13][10][13][10]After traveling to 2000 B.C., the music changes and a multiball starts to indicate the switch. The goal is to rescue nine human sacrifices and kill the Minotaur. The LOONY LABYRINTH lights at the center of the table turn on to show the number of hostages, turning off with every saved victim. Shooting the labyrinth ramp rescues them one at time. After everyone is safe, a multiball starts where the player must sink three balls in the Minotaur chamber before the moon phase indicators near the flippers turn off, to defeat the creature and win the game.

1040w	RattlerR	Rattler Race (1991).zip	27932359	Rattler Race	1991	Christopher Lee Fraley	Microsoft Corporation	Action;Strategy	Very much a snake game, Rattler Race adds a few twists to the long-held conventions of the genre (those being: you guide a snake from a top-down perspective, always in forward motion; it eats its targets and grows in length, but dies should it collide with any obstacles): in addition to a competing snake foiling your routes, a ball bounces around the play-field, Pong-style, killing your snake should the ball ricochet against its head.The other standout qualities are largely cosmetic: periodically enemy movement "freezes", giving the player a period of free motion; the opposing snake will also "eat" your targets (here "apples" -- occasionally bonus "golden apples") and grow longer, though it doesn't seek them out; gameplay can be conducted with as many as three opposing snakes and three bouncing balls complicating the playfield at once; you head for the exit once all apples are eaten, but the enemy snake(s) can exit instead, restarting the level.  Triumph against all these odds and you get 29 more levels of similar gameplay!This unremarkable clone is largely known on account of having been included in the original Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows.

Adventure	On a beautiful sunny day, King Graham of Daventry decides to take a stroll in the woods surrounding his castle.  When he returns, he discovers with horror that his home, Daventry Castle, has completely disappeared!  Graham is at a loss, and wonders how this could have happened, when a talking owl named Cedric appears.  He tells him that he saw the whole thing, and that an evil wizard named Mordack whisked the entire castle away, along with Graham's family in it.  Cedric offers to take him to his homeland, Serenia, where his master, the wizard Crispin resides.  Surely Crispin will be able to help King Graham rescue his family from Mordack's clutches.King's Quest V: Absence Makes the Heart Go Yonder is an adventure game, and the first from Sierra to use a point-and-click mouse interface.  Rather than typing commands on a keyboard to interact with the game world and use the arrow keys to walk around, King's Quest V instead simplifies all actions down to base commands.  To access the different cursors, the player can move the mouse to the top of the screen, revealing a hidden menu with each of the different actions, as well as game options and the inventory bag.  By clicking the "Walk" cursor on the screen, Graham will walk as close as he can to the appropriate area.  Clicking the "Eye" cursor on items will provide a description, the same as typing "Look at".  The "Hand" cursor is a multipurpose cursor that can be used to push, pull, interact with and pick up objects.  The "Head" cursor is used to talk to people (and in the strange world of King's Quest, often objects and animals, too).  Players can also right-click to cycle through the different available cursors.  Inventory that Graham picks up now gets placed into a bag.  By clicking on the bag, this opens up a sub-window that displays all the inventory that Graham currently has.  In here, players can look at or interact with objects, combine them with other objects, or pick them up to use them in the game environment as another cursor.As with most Sierra games, it is quite possible to die.  Bumping into witches, poisonous scorpions, falling off edges of cliffs, dying of thirst in the desert, and many other objects, locations and characters will send Graham to an untimely demise.  The player must be cautious as they explore Serenia - frequent game saving across multiple files is usually the best course of action to make sure that you don't get stuck or have to start right from the game's very beginning.

Both the painting and the objects are drawn with a 3D perspective which gives the player clues about placement. Further, the player can elect to bring up a vanishing point line grid for help.The composition section demonstrates how elements of paintings convey meaning. One game that illustrates this concept asks the player to match which shape or concept (circle, triangle, balanced scale, or unbalanced scale) best represents each of a selection of paintings.The life of art category features a jigsaw puzzle game using square pieces.

271w	MidStran	Midnight Stranger (1993).zip	383960947	Midnight Stranger	1993	Jeff Green	Animatics Multimedia	Adult;Adventure;Interactive Movie	This is the first of two published interactive multimedia CD-ROM based collaborations between writer and director Jeff Green and the Animatics Multimedia Corporation. Noted for its cinéma vérité style, it is a Point Of View (POV) video-based experiment in simulated socializing that takes place in an anonymous city late one night. Players navigate between several locations, and can interact with one or more people in each location to varying effects based on the player's “reactions” to that person. The main technical innovation of Midnight Stranger is its use of an emotional continuum Mood Bar for interaction with the in-story characters rather than a text interface or an itemized set of options for each interaction. The Mood Bar simulates some of the frustration and uncertainty when dealing with other people in social situations, and provides a more realistic role playing experience.

In their turn each player faces a round of five questions. Each question is timed and is worth a certain amount of points or air-miles, but that value decreases over time. When a round has been completed the game shows a humorous video of some form of transport, usually early aircraft. When all players have completed their round the game shoes a representation of the earth and how far the players have traveled with their accumulated air miles.[13][10][13][10]Questions are obviously based on geography and countries of the world. Identifying a natoins flag is a common kind of question as is recognising a country from a picture of its scenery or a local market, knowledge of capital cities and major exports helps too.[13][10][13][10]The quiz ends when a player has made a complete circuit of the earth. The scoreboard does not show high scores because a trip around the earth is always the same distance, instead it shows the percentage of questions answered correctly.

1210w	TitAdvOT	Titanic - Adventure Out of Time (1996).zip	1318866890	Titanic: Adventure Out of Time	1996	Cyberflix Incorporated	GTE Entertainment	Adventure	Titanic: Adventure Out of Time is an open-ended first-person adventure game set on the doomed maiden voyage of the HMS Titanic. The player takes the role of Frank Carlson, a disgraced British secret service agent. His career having ended after he failed in a mission on board the HMS Titanic, he now lives in a small apartment, surrounded by mementos of his past. Somehow, however, Carlson is thrown backward into his past to April of 1912, giving the player an opportunity to change the events on board the doomed ship. While the player is not able to avert the sinking of the Titanic, they are able to influence not only Frank's timeline but that of the other passengers on board the ship and, indeed, the progression of subsequent human history. As a result, details of the game's plot are affected by the player's actions, which can result in one of any number of significant or minutely different endings.The game is a puzzle-solving adventure game which utilizes a simple, point-and-click system in order for the player to interact with the world. While the game is played in the form of a traditional adventure game, it expands on this established system by constructing its game play around the idea of a continuous, transitory world. While the player still progresses through the game primarily through solving puzzles and interacting with other characters it presents these interactions as taking place within an active, malleable world. Characters, for instance, periodically move about the ship, and can be found in different portions of the ship during different times of day as they pursue their lives apart from the player. Puzzles are similarly tied to this progression of time, and players may choose to pursue plot lines how ever they think is best, influencing both the plot and other puzzles within the game, allowing them to completely overlook or pass over entire puzzles and story points. Early in the game, for instance, the player is asked to locate an item hidden by another character. If they're able to discover its location early enough, they can take the item from its hiding spot before someone else does. If they're sidetracked by other characters within the world, or in some other way too slow in locating the object, the hiding spot will be empty and the plot will accommodate this development. It is important to note, however, that the game does not progress in real-time as other adventures, such as The Last Express, do. Rather, time progresses due to the player solving a puzzle or in some other way advancing the game.In addition to the traditional puzzles within the game, there are also mini-games which the player can participate in either for fun or to influence the plot, such as poker and fencing.The game is presented using 3D graphics, although the player still moves through the game by shifting from screen to screen, similar in style to the movement found in other adventure titles such as Riven. The bottom of the screen features a nautically-themed interface featuring a life preserver (the menu), a pocket watch (which represents the in-game time), a rolled piece of parchment (a map of the ship), and a leather case (the inventory).

From the title screen players can choose one of the five available puppies and interact with them using the mouse. The dog can be picked up and dragged around, and it lives on the player's desktop. The dog needs to be fed and you can play with them, scold them, and teach them tricks. It is also possible to take pictures and design a playpen for them. In other applications the dog can grab your attention by holding on to the cursor, or you can throw a ball to keep it busy while doing something else.When the dog is not fed or cared for, for a long time, it dies. This concept was also used as a business incentive. The game was distributed freely, but only came with five days of food. Because without food the dog would die in the demo version, this encouraged players to pay the $20 to get the full game and an unlimited amount of food.

Adult;Simulation	One day Ariel, an ordinary schoolgirl, is left after the classes by her biology teacher. The teacher, a pervert, as every girl in the school seems to know, seduces Ariel. While he does it, he is transformed into the Overlord, a creature who seduces and tortures girls and young women. As Ariel reaches her climax a portal opens dragging her 900 years into the future. There she learns of Overlord's time portals, through which he has set up a series of erotic torture dens for young girls across time and space.  Ariel now becomes an Ultra Vixen and she decides to use her Superclimax power to disrupt the continuum and seal Overlord's temporal access. To do so Ariel will have to channel herself into the minds of sexually tortured victims and reach the climax. The game is divided into 3 levels: WWII Germany, present time Tokyo subway train and distant future. Each level is divided into several stages; the goal of each stage is to get Ariel's sexual excitement to the maximum using various tools at hand. Using right tools will add some points to the score and move the story forward, while using tools that Ariel currently dislikes may deduct the points from the score and ultimately bring the game to Game Over. Most actions are done by selecting a tool and rapidly moving it back and forth for some time. The heroine and the tools are in 3D.

Role-Playing	Betrayal in Antara uses an updated version of the game engine from Betrayal at Krondor. However, it does not continue the Raymond E. Feist's Riftwar saga, but instead starts a new tale set in a different fantasy world, known as Ramar.The story begins with William Escobar, the son of the governor of Pianda, sailing home to meet his fiancee. The ship is attacked by pirates, and William escapes in a life boat with a mortally wounded traveler. Before he dies, the stranger gives William a medallion, warning him of a conspiracy against the Empire. William meets a young magician named Aren, who has just discovered devastating powers within himself, and the two decide to meet William's father and ask for his advice concerning the unsettling information.The game plays very similarly to Betrayal at Krondor. The player navigates a party of three characters through the 3D world. Enemy encounter triggers a separate battle screen, on which player-controlled party and the enemies engage in turn-based combat. Cities are usually displayed as still pictures, with various locations accessible via menu-based navigation. Like in Betrayal at Krondor, there are only two character classes in the game, warrior and mage. The skill system is also nearly identical; skills are improved by repeatedly using them, and marking them in the skill menu for faster learning. Elements like a day/night cycle, weapon and armor repairing, navigation on world map, the necessity to carry rations, etc. are also brought over from the earlier  Dynamix game.

Once a monster is created, one can play a variety of games and activities with it, such as making music, getting clothing and accessories, or printing it out. Monster Maker was designed for creative play, like a paint program. There were no overarching goals other than to have fun.

The player walks and jumps through the six levels and punches his enemies to defeat them. To avoid certain enemies or bullets he can dodge by ducking. The energy bar on the bottom of the screen decreases when hit by an enemy and when reaching zero the player loses one of his three lives. Before every level an animated Padre Orso and extracts from the series explain the purpose of the level. The platforming part of the game is entirely in comic graphics. The game CD includes a video interview with Bud Spencer.				Single Player		false	74a24c7c-fcc0-ae6c-6405-05f746073eab

279w	macbeth	Macbeth (1995).zip	220138805	Macbeth	1995	The Voyager Company	The Voyager Company	Education;Reference	One of the best CD-ROMs ever made and the best software ever made about Shakespeare's works, Voyager's Macbeth is a masterpiece in literary CD-ROM. The CD not only includes the fully indexed and searchable text of Shakespeare's famous tragedy (based on the recently published Cambridge edition, edited by one of the CD-ROM's co-authors, Professor A. R. Braunmuller), but more importantly the *complete audio performance* of the entire play by the Royal Shakespeare Company, directed by Trevor Nunn, which stars Ian McKellan as Macbeth, and Judi Dench as Lady Macbeth. Definitely one of the best renditions of the play ever performed. In terms of user interface, Voyager outdid themselves with Macbeth. Not only can you jump to any page or word, but you can also click on any line of the play to go directly to that place in the RSC's audio performance and hear it read out loud. There are numerous notes, anecdotes, and glossary items (over 1,500 of them), all of which are hyperlinked and indexed, and 25,000-word worth of extensive essays that analyze the play in detail. And if that's not enough, you can view video clips from other performances of key scenes, from Macbeth movies directed by Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, and Roman Polanski. To top it all off, there's plenty of maps, charts, and images to make this the definitive CD-ROM about the play. As always, you can copy any text from the CD-ROM to paste it into a word processor of your choice. Macbeth is without a doubt another high quality title from Voyager, one that successfully marries the scholarly expertise of the authors -- in this case Drs. Rodes and Braunmuller, two Shakespearian scholars -- with Voyager's technical and design expertise in creating attractive CD-ROMs. If you have even a slight interest in Shakespeare, this wonderful CD-ROM is a must-have.

Strategy	Allied General is the sequel to Panzer General and uses the same turn-based gameplay mechanics. This time the player experiences World War II from the Allied point of view during two British, one U.S. and one Russian campaign. The settings are Europe, Russia and Northern Africa.The most important thing to have are prestige points. These are earned by solving scenarios (more for a little amount of turns) and used to buy replacement units. But this is not the only reason to be concerned about the detailed mission results: surviving units are transferred to the next mission and receive experience points. The campaign is also not completely linear, and the next mission depends on the result of the last - this means a lost scenario does not necessarily result in a game over, and a scarce victory can have devastating results. Of course a great victory has positive effects on the next missions.Every turn the player plans the actions of his units and tries to defeat his enemy. The complexity of the game mostly comes from the many different units and weapons - everything has their use and weaknesses. It is vital to use the resources in the correct order and combination. There are also other factors to think about, e.g. fuel. Allied General tries to be player friendly by giving feedback during turns, e.g. by showing the probable combat result before the player issues the attack. He can also undo a turn as long as no new enemy units are scouted. Other extras are historical film material and optional combat animations.	5-Star General series; Historical conflict: World War II; Panzer General series		E - Everyone		Allied General (1995).pdf	false	b0669f36-90b9-683b-f721-219ac32caeaf

Virgin Interactive Entertainment, Inc.	Adventure	Cover-Up at Roswell is an adventure game based on the Jonny Quest animated television series. Over 50 minutes of footage of the show from various episodes was used to construct a new story as a game, along with a number of new sequences. The story details the Roswell incident where an alien UFO crashes into the earth. General Tyler and his Men in Black immediately salvage the wreckage, but a number of alien components has been scattered around the globe. Players guide the Quest team, consisting of Jonny, Jessie and Hadji, to keep the components out of the hands of Tyler and the genius Jeremiah Surd.The characters are guided through different scenes all around the world. They can be moved around, choose an item, grab it or hold it. The five alien objects need to be found using a tracking device that pin-points the location on a GPS. This takes the team to the Devil's Triangle, New York, Peru, Tanzania and Utah. Next to the main gameplay and cut-scenes, there is a large number of mini-games such as matching sequences, board games, rafting, shooting rats with a slingshot, jeep driving, fire extinguishing, and many more.Certain segments of the game were designed in 3D and Chromatek plastic viewing glasses were provided with the game to view these.

So the player, controlling James T. Kirk, commander of the original NCC-1701 Enterprise, is ordered to stop that invasion.WinTrek is Star Trek simulation game, where the player virtually controls every aspect of the Enterprise, including those that would normally be done by the crew.For navigating the Enterprise through the sectors and quadrants, the player does not "drive" her, but instead controls the navigation station directly (setting course, whereby any of the 360 degrees can be used, and setting speed limits, both impulse and warp). During combat, the player has to manage shields, coordinate phaser fire and photon torpedoes, including the control of how much dilithium (fuel) is invested into shields and weapons. Finally, the player must manage the dilithium fuel (i.e. refilling at starbases) and make sure that the ship doesn't break apart (damage system).The game is won when the enemy armada is destroyed, and lost when the armada attacks Earth, or when the player-controlled ship runs out of fuel or explodes. Both the number of enemy ships and the days available to the player are randomly set when the game is started. The game offers six difficulty levels, ranging from Admiral (expert) to Expandable Crewman (easiest). In-game Computer Station acts like a computer operation system, allowing the player to get information not visible at the other stations (e.g. retrieve the position of the starbases). Information is displayed in 11 sub-windows of the game window, which are all re-sizable and movable.

The game takes place on an island, which is a grid of hexagon tiles divided up between the 6 players. You must try to capture your enemies' territory, and the goal of the game is to conquer land and control the largest area. There are four types of troops, each stronger then the lesser ones. The weakest are the peasants (displayed as an unarmed man), spearmen (peasants with spear and shield), knights and the strongest are the barons (knight with spear and shield). The troops are upgraded by combining lesser troops. Some tiles contain resources or assets which the players can use to their advantage, like a castle, a cottage or trees.[13][10][13][10]The game covers many of the basic principles of war, such as the divide and conquer principle, the perils of multi front warfare, knowing when to attack and when to defend, finding the enemies weak spots and protect your own. It is also a game of resource management and risk assessment; for example, barons use up more resources from the territory.

With narration and live video, children can interact with the characters and participate in the adventures. There's very little actual game afoot here - the entire story plays out in badly-animated CG clips of a talking skull, except when he's a live-action badly-synched talking skull. There's audio narration over still images and low-budget full motion video clips with the dialogue dubbed in later. In many of the live-action sequences, it appears that the acquired footage was damaged, or the script was changed, or (most likely) there just wasn't enough footage to cover the dialogue. So much of the story is told using still frames or repeated clips to support the post-dubbed dialogue. Oh, the drama! The low-budget production values! The cheesy video effects!

BMG Interactive Entertainment	Adventure	Where Prince Interactive takes hours to finish and attempts to offer a career overview, Bowie's CD-ROM skips the ch-ch-changes and rehashes videos and songs from his 1993 Black Tie White Noise album. After the opening credits, you enter an elevator and walk down the corridors of a gray office building matching the set for the music video "Jump They Say". You are given a choice of entering three rooms: the David Bowie suite, the video suite or Room 2901. Inside the David Bowie suite is an office with desk, filing cabinet and chair. By clicking a camera sitting on the desk, you hear a 10-minute audio interview with shallow off-the-cuff commentary from Bowie, illustrated with photographs from a recording session. Clicking a briefcase on the floor launches an equally unsatisfying 10-minute video interview. Room 2901 contains a telescope. Looking through the telescope, you enter rooms in a hotel across the street to watch four music videos: "Jump They Say," "Black Tie, White Noise," "Miracle Goodnight" and "You've Been Around." The videos play in a window filling an eighth of the screen and look almost as good as MTV. Inexplicably, the hotel rooms contain little hidden surprises that seem to have wandered onto the disk from some children's game - click on a dog, for example, and it barks; click on a bowling trophy, and a bowling ball rolls across the floor. The video suite puts you at the controls of a video-editing machine where you create a customized version of "Jump They Say." The creativity is strictly limited, however, to selecting from five video tracks playing simultaneously, designating one to display on the main screen.

It combines varied "find out what to do" levels requiring timing and deduction from the player with some massive exuberant nonsensical humour extruding from each and every pore of the game -- beginning with the game's title, but certainly not ending there.[13][10][13][10]The unlikely heroine and protagonist of this game is middle-aged, good-natured Nelda Nockbladder -- part housewife, part sheep, part mad scientist -- who, while teleporting to the snack bar after her daily workout, finds herself trapped in anatomy lessons "due to a wrinkle in Neldaspace". The player's mission is to safely bring Nelda to the snack bar.[13][10][13][10]The game consists of eleven colourful levels -- the different lessons --, where Nelda will have to find out about what's going on and how to solve it. She has several means to achieve this: She can walk and jump, spit "flaming custard", climb things, hunker down and "ponder a greezbock" (which does absolutely nothing). The lessons contain various nondescript fast flying or gently bobbing objects (like the much-feared Elasticow or the Blue Plate Geelynob), switches and buttons to be pressed, everything often mutating or exploding when touching the floor, spat custard at, kicked or banged with the head.

If no "Trumpf" is played the highest value scores. At the end each player counts the values of his cards. The goal for the single player is to get more points than the other two combined.[13][10][13][10]The main feature of Skat 2095 is the integration of many local skat variants. If your favorite rule set is not included you can create it yourself with the freely adjustable rules.

The game starts in a command center where the player can read up on the events that led to the global disaster, outfit the vehicle with different types of weapons, and interview candidates for the position of co-pilot in the hovercraft (Nikki, Chablis, Limbaugh, Thrash, Lark or Dogstar). Their in-game comments bring a different atmosphere to the gameplay.While flying, there are three boroughs to search for pods: The Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan. The hovercraft can be moved around, it can switch between a hover and a fly mode, and players need to aim and fire weapons. As that is too much for the player to handle, tasks can be delegated to the AI co-pilot. When the pods have been found, a boss character guarding the exit needs to be taken out.While playing, the game area takes up only half of the screen. The rest is reserved for incoming video messages (including taunting opponents), general options, weapon selection, a radar, a compass, and basic statistics about ammo, fuel, shields, the pods and cash. While searching the cities, targets such as jets, sleds, helicopters, tanks and armoured cars need to be engaged. When low on fuel, shield power or weapons, the fuel truck, weapons lady (in a helicopter) and the repair bay can be visited.
